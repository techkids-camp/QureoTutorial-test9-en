## Let's get the agent to place blocks!

``||agent.agent place forward||`` blocks and``||agent.agent move forward by 1 block||`` blocks to get the agent to place blocks! To make the agent move in a different direction, click on the “forward” part and a menu will appear where you can choose!

After that, press the button on the bottom right![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camp-minecraft/TechkidsCampTutorial/master/images/playbutton.png) to start the program!
